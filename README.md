balenaSense is a Raspberry Pi [balenaCloud](https://www.balena.io/cloud/) starter project taking readings from a **either a Bosch BME680 sensor, a Sense-HAT, or a 1-wire temperature sensor (such as a Dallas DS18B20)**, storing using InfluxDB and reporting using Grafana.

We want to create a project that motivates users to build their own environmental sensor project whether for home or for professional use with privacy and customization in mind.

Contributors are welcome to improve this software, add sensor support, and help one another get the most out of this project.
